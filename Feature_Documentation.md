<hr>

1. 'pl_orbper' - Planet orbital period, in days.
2. 'pl_orbsmax' - Major axis of the planet's orbit.
    * This is one size measurement for the planet's orbit, in AU (short for Astronomical Unit, which is the distance from the Earth to the sun)
3. 'pl_orbeccen' - The eccentricity of the planet's orbit.
    * This is 0 if the planet has a circular orbit, and becomes larger for planets with a more elliptical orbit.
4. 'pl_orbincl' - Angle of inclination of the planet's orbit.
5. 'pl_bmassj' - Mass of the planet, measured as a fraction of Jupiter's mass.
6. 'pl_radj' - Radius of the planet, as a fraction of Jupiter's radius.
7. 'pl_dens' - Planet density, in units of grams per cubic centimeter.
8. 'st_dist' - Distance from the Earth to the host star, in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parsec">parsecs</a>, which is about 3.26 light years.
9. 'st_optmag' - ,a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apparent_magnitude">Optical magnitude</a> of the star.
10. 'st_teff' - Effective temperature of the host star in Kelvin.  (Kelvin = Celsius - 273.15 degrees)
11. 'st_mass' - Mass of the host star, as a fraction of the Sun's mass.
12. 'st_rad', - Radius of the host star, as a fraction of the Sun's radius.
13. st_logg' - Gravitational accelaration at the surface of the star, in meters per second squared.
14. 'st_dens' - Density of the host star, in grams per cubic centimeter.
15. 'st_lum' - 
16. 'pl_rvamp'
17. 'pl_eqt'
18. 'st_plx'
19. 'st_age'
20. 'st_vsini'
21. 'st_acts'
