<hr>

1. 'pl_orbper' - Planet orbital period, in days
2. 'pl_orbsmax' - Major axis of the planet's orbit
    * This is one size measurement for the planet's orbit
3. 'pl_orbeccen' - The eccentricity of the planet's orbit
    * This is 0 if the planet has a circular orbit, and becomes larger for planets with a more elliptical orbit.
4. 'pl_orbincl' - Angle of inclination of the planet's orbit.
5. 'pl_bmassj' - Mass of the planet, measured as a fraction of Jupiter's mass.
