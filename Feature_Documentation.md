1. <span style="color:blue">'pl_orbper'</span> - Planet orbital period, in days
2. <span style="color:red">'pl_orbsmax'</span> - Major axis of the planet's orbit
    * This is one size measurement for the planet's orbit
3. <span style="color:red">'pl_orbeccen'</span> - The eccentricity of the planet's orbit
    * This is 0 if the planet has a circular orbit, and becomes larger for planets with a more elliptical orbit.
4. <span style="color:red">'pl_orbincl'</span> - Angle of inclination of the planet's orbit.
5. <span style="color:red">'pl_bmassj'</span> - Mass of the planet, measured as a fraction of Jupiter's mass.
