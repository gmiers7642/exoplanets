# What can we quickly discover about exoplanets using out-of-the box tools in Python?
## We will use:
* ScikitLearn KMeans clustering
* Numpy Singular Value decomposition (SVD)
* ScikitLearn Agglomerative clustering
* Matplotlib for plotting and interpretation of data
* Pandas and Numpy for quick and convenient data manipulation
