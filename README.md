### 1. <a id="1Unsupervised Learning">Unsupervised Learning</a>
* Very powerful technique for exploratory data analysis (EDA)
* There are many applications for unsupervised learning
    * Marketing
    * Genetics
    * Politics
    * Many others
* Here, unsupervised learning has been used to detect interesting structure in exoplanet data available from the <a href="http://exoplanetarchive.ipac.caltech.edu/">NASA exoplanet archive,</a>

<hr>

### 2. <a href="2Exoplanets">What are exoplanets</a>
* Exoplanets are planets that we have discovered outside of our solar system
* There is a LOT of data available on exoplanets, for instance:

* Pandas and Numpy for quick and convenient data manipulation

###What can we quickly discover about exoplanets using out-of-the box tools in Python?
* What are some common characteristics of exoplanets?
* Where are they in relation to the Earth and Sun?
* How similar are they to the Earth and Sun?
* What are Habitable planets, and how do they compare to the Earth and Sun?
