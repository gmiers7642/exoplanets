# exoplanets

## What are exoplanets?
* Exoplanets are planets that we have discovered outside of our solar system
* There is a LOT of data available on exoplanets, for instance:
  * http://exoplanetarchive.ipac.caltech.edu/index.html

# What can we quickly discover about exoplanets using out-of-the box tools in Python?
* What are some common characteristics of exoplanets?
* Where are they in relation to the Earth and Sun?
* How similar are they to the Earth and Sun?
* What are Habitable planets, and how do they compare to the Earth and Sun?

## We will use:
* ScikitLearn KMeans clustering
* Numpy Singular Value decomposition (SVD)
* ScikitLearn Agglomerative clustering
* Matplotlib for plotting and interpretation of data
* Pandas and Numpy for quick and convenient data manipulation
